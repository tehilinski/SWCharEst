SWCharEst
=========

SWCharEst is an implementation of an algorithm that estimates soil
hydrological parameters from soil text and organic matter content
using the method of Saxton and Rawls (2006).

The implementations are in four programming languages:
C++, Fortran90, Python3, and R.

All implementations are in object-oriented form as a class,
or in the case of Fortran90, as a module. Each has an
accompanying test program that demonstrates the class use.
The name of each class is **SWCharEst**.

Source code for the classes are in the ``src`` directory.
Source code for the test programs are in the ``tests`` directory.
At the top of each file is an explanation with usage examples.

| Language  | Class File      | Test File          |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| C++	    | SWCharEst.cpp/h | Test_SWCharEst.cpp |
| Fortran90 | SWCharEst.f90   | Test_SWCharEst.f90 |
| Python3   | SWCharEst.py    | Test_SWCharEst.py  |
| R         | SWCharEst.R     | Test_SWCharEst.R   |


# Calculating the soil hydrologic parameters

Input:

| value                 | units                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------  |
| sand weight fraction  | fraction in range 0-1        |
| clay weight fraction  | fraction in range 0-1        |
| soil organic matter   | weight percent (70% maximum) |

Results:

| variable | description                      | units           |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | --------------- |
| WP       | wilting point                    | volume fraction |
| FC       | field capacity                   | volume fraction |
| thetaS   | saturated water content          | volume fraction |
| Ks       | saturated hydraulic conductivity | cm/sec          |

Each class implementation has two public methods.
**Usage** displays the use of the class.
**Get** returns a vector (or array or list)
containing the results of the calculations:
WP, FC, thetaS, Ks, in that order.

## Units

The units of the calculated variables in the Saxton and Rawls
paper are volumn percent for WP, FC and thetaS, and mm/hour for Ks.
Conversions are:

* volume % = volume fraction * 100
* mm/hour = cm/sec * 36000

The R script ``tests/SaxtonRawls_Table3.R`` calculates the estimates
for each soil texture in Saxton and Rawls (2006), table 3 using
SWCharEst.R. The differences between table 3 and the new
estimates are displayed. All differences are zero.
